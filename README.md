You can use package manages like bower for web resoureces in the resoureces folder.

For JavaScript upcalls extend the JavaScriptBridge class.  Will be adding more functions to this class in the future.
Right now it has 2 methods selectFile and selectFolder wich take a javascript callback function and return the file or folder path.
